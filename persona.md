## Use Case
Molly's classmate Jerry told her about ArtStation, a networking website for artists that allows them to post their work and reach out to other working artists. 
Molly would also have access to a marketplace for assets, blogs and tutorials from artists all over the world, and could curate the kind of art she wants to see more of at anytime.
* pre-condition Molly is logged into her account and is viewing her page.
* post-condition Molly posted a new piece of artwork to her page's portfolio.
