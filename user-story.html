    <h2>Use Case</h2>
   <p>Molly's classmate Jerry told her about ArtStation, a networking website for artists
       that allows them to post their work and reach out to other working artists.
       Molly would also have access to a marketplace for assets, blogs and tutorials from artists all over the world,
       and could curate the kind of art she wants to see more of at anytime.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>pre-condition Molly is logged into her account and is viewing her page.</li>
        <li>post-condition Molly posted a new piece of artwork to her page's portfolio.</li>
    </ul>
